# Authentication Library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/activecollab/authentication.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/activecollab/authentication)

Authentication library builds on top of `activecollab/user` package. There are three types of visitors that we recognize:

1. Unidentified visitors - Visitors that we know nothing bout,
1. Identified visitors - People that we identified when they provided their email address,
1. Users with accounts - People with actual accounts in our application.
